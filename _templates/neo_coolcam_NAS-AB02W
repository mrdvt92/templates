This is a Tuya siren with temperature and humidity sensor. Runs on USB and two CR123A batteries as backup (not supplied with the device). 

## Hardware Versions

There are three known hardware versions ymf:1.0.1, ymf:1.0.2 and 9fn:1.0.2.  The console after reboot will show one of these code on a line with "TYA: MCU Product ID:".

- `{"p":"ymf4oruxqx0xlogp","v":"1.0.1","m":0}`
- `{"p":"ymf4oruxqx0xlogp","v":"1.0.2","m":0}`
- `{"p":"9fngbrgje6ljqhee","v":"1.0.2","m":0}` 

The `ymf` versions work with tuya-convert but the `9fn` version requires flashing the device with serial.

The 1.0.1 version supports the `[TuyaSend0](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#tuyasend)` command to query the MCU for the latest values but the 1.0.2 version does not appear to support that command at this time (2021-03-05). (see <a href="https://discord.com/channels/479389167382691863/790917300210368562/817253209894027294">discord</a>)

In an order on 2021-01-31 for three devices, one of each hardware versions was received.  In an order from 2020-12, the ymf:1.0.1 version was received, which is rock solid.

## Flashing

If you have issues flashing with tuya-convert you can flash the device using serial. 

Steps:

- Remove the three screws from the bottom and the lid comes off easily
- Connect GPIO0 ("IO0") to ground ("GND")
- Connect the USB to power (there is no need to power from the serial device)
- Continue to hold the GPIO0 to ground for about 5-10 seconds to ensure that the chip is in flashing mode (there are no hardware indications)
- Hold the TX and RX from the serial to the pads "RXD0" and "TXD0" (cross the streams)
- Then Tasmotize - I was successful with tasmotizer-1.2.exe and tasmota-sensors.bin (9.1.3).

## Configuration

Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process.

Disable Power Cycle recovery, turn on TuyaReceived publish to MQTT and change device to a TuyaMCU module 
```console
Backlog SetOption65 1; SetOption66 1; Module 54
```
Map alarm control to POWER
```console
TuyaMCU 11,104
```

## Functions
Alarm will be turned on or off using POWER. 

- dpId 101 - power type (1 - battery high; 2 - medium; 3 - low; 4 - usb port)
- dpId 102 - alarm type chime sound (0-17)
- dpId 103 - alarm duration time (in seconds)
- dpId 104 - alarm control
- dpId 105 - temp in C (divide by 10) 
- dpId 106 - humidity
- dpId 107 - minimum temperature to trigger alarm
- dpId 108 - maximum temperature to trigger alarm
- dpId 109 - minimum humidity to trigger alarm
- dpId 110 - maximum humidity to trigger alarm
- dpId 112 - unit change (on = C, off = F) - does not affect dpid 105 values
- dpId 113 - temperature alarm control (0 = off, 1 = on)
- dpId 114 - humidity alarm control (0 = off, 1 = on)
- dpId 116 - alarm volume (0 = high, 1 = medium, 2 = low)

### Chime sounds:

- 0 - doorbell
- 1 - fuer elise
- 2 - big ben
- 3 - ring ring
- 4 - lone ranger
- 5 - turkish march
- 6 - high pitch siren
